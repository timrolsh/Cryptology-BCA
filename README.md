# cryptology-bca

Work for Cryptology elective at BCA, taken tri 2 of 2022-2023 school year.

The work for this class was all lab work, no tests or quizzes. Python was the language used as it automatically expanded the size of ints making it easy to work with very large numbers, which was what was mainly done in each class. The [SecretEncryptionLab implementation](./SecretEncryptionLab/SecretEncryptionLab.py) has some errors, and does not correctly encrypt/decrypt some messages.

I could not figure out what the error was, if you can figure it out, make a PR and I will merge it.
